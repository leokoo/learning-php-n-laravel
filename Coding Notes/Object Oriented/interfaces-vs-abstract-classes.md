## What's the difference?

- Interfaces can only implement public functions. However, no logic will be stored in an interface.
- In some cases, you'll find you'll use interface & abstract class on the same implementation
- abstract classes cannot be instantiated on its own
- We implement an abstract class when we find our classes all use similar methods. Then we've to ask ourselves if we can do it in an abstract class and have all the functionality up there.
