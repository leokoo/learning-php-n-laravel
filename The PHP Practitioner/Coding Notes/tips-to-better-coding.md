# Coding

## On writing code

### Writing Style
- Name it base on whatever feels right to you, and then make your class / method / function offer that functionality
- It's ok to write code and reference methods that don't exist -> try to define it in the best possible way for your mind
- What will make you understand this best?
- Define Code >> Write Code >> See it fail >> Make it work (by writing the classes and functions into place)

### The Idea
- Extract any re-usable code and extract it out to
	- A partial (for views)
	- A function
